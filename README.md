# CTEC2904 Test GIT Project
As part of (CTEC2904 - Software and Security Management) module, one of the main subjects is version control where I use GitHub. Therefore, the file(s) that already exist in the repository is strictly for this module's purposes, which has been granted permission from the module's leader.
